## CR 1 - Resources

_The teacher and students have access to college-level computer science resources, in print or electronic format._

The primary teaching resource in this course is _Introduction to Computing_, an eTextbook authored by K-State faculty. The textbook consists of lecture material and videos developed and presented by K-State faculty, as well as an annotated bibliography of additional readings and videos from across the internet on each topic. The textbook is used in two college-level courses taught at K-State:

* CIS 115 - Introduction to Computing Science
* CC 110 - Introduction to Computing

The textbook can be found online at:

* Primary Link: https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc110/
* Alternate Link: https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cszero/ 
* Authors & Contributors: https://core.cs.ksu.edu/authors/

## CR 2 - Develop Understanding of Content

_The course provides opportunities to develop student understanding of the required content outlined in each of the big ideas described in the AP Course and Exam Description._

The course consists of two major types of content:

* Lecture Content, Videos, Discussions, Activities & Quizzes - roughly 2 college credit hours
* Programming Content, Labs, and Homeworks - roughly 1 college credit hour
