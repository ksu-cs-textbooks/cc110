## Notes About This Selection

While the creation on Babbage's Difference Engine #2 was turned down by the government, we get to see this machine which was built in modern times. Babbage had a small prototype which he would demonstrate for party guests and it was clear to those who saw it, that Babbage was incredibly talented and intelligent. This is further proven by the prototype's modern counterpart. It is astonishing that it was created with such precision using just pencils and paper!
