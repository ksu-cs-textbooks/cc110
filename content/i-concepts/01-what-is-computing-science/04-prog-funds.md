There are two techniques that we would like to explicitly mention before we get too far into the course: decomposition and iteration. These concepts are crucial in helping us be better programmers and problem solvers. 

First we will talk about decomposition. This is the process of breaking something down into smaller pieces. We can think of the biological process where organic matter decomposes and breaks apart into smaller organic elements. Another general technique is decomposing everyday tasks. For example, we can take a large task, such as getting to school on time and break it into small steps like, wake up at 6AM, brush teeth, get changed, eat breakfast and so on. We can note that some of those tasks can be decomposed into smaller parts as well.

In computer science this decomposition is precisely this idea. We will see an example of this Newton's method of differences for solving polynomial equations. Can you identify the small steps that we used to solve the equations?

The second technique is iteration. This is when we repeat the same step many times to achieve a larger task. For physical real world examples, we can think of assembly lines. Each station does the same task numerous times to produce duplicates of a product, such as vehicles or cell phones. We can also see this in textile arts such as knitting and crocheting. We repeat the same small steps many times to produce hats and scarves. 

In the sciences, iteration is this repetitive idea as well. We know that multiplication is repeated addition. As with decomposition, we will see this in future videos. Can you identify where and what steps are getting repeated?
