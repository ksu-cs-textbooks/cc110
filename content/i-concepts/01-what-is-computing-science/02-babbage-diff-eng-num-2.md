## Notes About This Selection

The director of the Computer Science Museum's Babbage Project demonstrates how Charles Babbage's Difference Engine #2 works. While Babbage himself was not able to build the machine in his lifetime, a modern builder created it according to Babbage's instructions. Through this creation, computer scientists have been able to prove that the Difference Engine works exactly as Babbage intended!
