## Notes About This Selection

In this video, Carrie Anne shares the principals of binary numbers and how we use Boolean Algebra to work with binary values. We get to see the truth tables for the basic statements (or, and, not, xor) as well as their respective logic gates. We also get a good primer for working on more complex statements.
