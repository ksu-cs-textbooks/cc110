In this lab, we covered several major important topics. Let's quickly review them.

## Pseudocode Input

* `INPUT()` will read input from the user and return what was typed as a string value.
* `INPUT()` is terminated by the user pressing ENTER, so next output starts on a new line.

## Pseudocode String Operators

* `+` Concatenation (join strings together). May only be applied to two strings.

## Returning Data from Procedures

* `RETURN(expression)` will return the value of `expression` to where the procedure was called from.
* Procedure calls can be used in assignment statements to store return values, or as part of other expressions.

## Python input

* `input(expression)` will display the `expression` to the user as a prompt, then return what was typed by the user as a string value.
* `input(expression)` is terminated by the user pressing ENTER, so next output starts on a new line.

## Python String Operators

* `+` Concatenation (join strings together). May only be applied to two strings.
* `string.format(value1, value2)` performs string formatting. The `string` portion is any valid template string, which contains curly braces `{}` as placeholders. Each placeholder will be replaced by the matching argument `value1`, `value2`, etc. from the `format()` method.  

## Returning Data from Functions

* `return expression` will return the value of `expression` to where the function was called from.
* Function calls can be used in assignment statements to store return values, or as part of other expressions.

## Complex statements

Expressions can be combined in many ways within a statement. Expressions can be used as arguments to procedures, and more!
