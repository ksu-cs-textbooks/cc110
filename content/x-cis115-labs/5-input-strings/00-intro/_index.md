Manipulating data is a key part of any useful computer program, and Python is a great language for learning how to do just that. In this lab, we're going to expand our knowledge of Python to include **numeric data types**, which allow us to store numbers in variables. We'll also learn about the **mathematical operators** we can use to manipulate the data in those variables, and how we can convert data between the various different types we've learned about so far.

In addition, we'll learn how we can manipulate the data stored in strings using **string operators** to build more useful outputs for our users. We'll also learn how to use the `input()` function to get input directly from the user in Python.

Finally, we'll also learn how to update our functions in Python to **return** a value. This allows us to use a function anywhere in an expression, since it now can be evaluated to a value. 

Once we've covered all of this, we'll finally be able to build some useful interactive programs in Python. Those programs will be able to collect input from the user, manipulate that input as data in some way, and then present helpful output to the user as a result. At that point, we'll be ready to tackle the first homework in this course!
