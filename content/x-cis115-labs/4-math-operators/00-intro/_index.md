A great way to think of a computer program is that it is a process of telling the computer how to store and manipulate data. Everything from simple calculators all the way to the latest video games can all fit this definition. So far, we've only worked with one type of data in this course - strings. Strings are very useful, since they can be used to print text and information for the user to see via the user interface, but they are very limited when it comes to other uses.

In this lab, we're going to introduce another type of data - **numeric data**. This will allow us to store and work with numbers in our program. We'll also learn about **operators** that we can use to actually manipulate the numeric data we are storing in our programs.

We'll also learn how we can use some of those operators to craft more useful output messages for our user through the use of some **string operators** as well.

Once we can manipulate data, it would be very useful for us to be able to create procedures that can be used in expressions to create a value. So, we'll learn how to **return** data from our procedures, allowing us to use them in expressions. 

Finally, we also need a way to collect data from the user, so we'll introduce a new statement in pseudocode, the **`INPUT()`** statement. This will allow us to build our first truly interactive programs in pseudocode. So, even though we can't execute pseudocode programs directly on a computer, we'll still be able to use our "mental model" of a computer to predict what the code would do. Like before, we're continuing to develop our programming skills by focusing first on what the code should do by learning pseudocode, and then we can see what it actually does when we learn the same concepts in Python a bit later. Let's get started!
