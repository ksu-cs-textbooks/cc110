In the last few labs, we explored how we can use iterative structures in our code, such as while loops and for loops, to repeat steps a certain number of times or while a Boolean condition is true. This is a very powerful tool, since it allows us to build programs that can repeatedly ask the user to provide input until a valid value is received, or even perform a repeated calculation until it reaches a desired result.

Loops, just like conditional statements, can also be nested inside of one another, allowing us to build even more complex programs. In fact, you may have already done this using loops and functions that contain loops in a previous lab without realizing it. In this lab, we'll explore how to combine loops in many different ways, and learn how we can test and debug these complex programs. 

After this lab, we'll learn about two different collection types in Python, and we'll quickly see how we can use loops to work with them quickly and easily. So, let's get started!
