In this lab, we introduced several major important topics in Python. Let's quickly review them.

## Nested Loops

Loops in Python can be nested, just like any other statement. While loops and for loops can be nested in any combination.

## Testing Nested Loops

When testing nested loops, it is important to consider situations where a loop will be executed and where it will be bypassed. It is also important to consider the loop variants for while loops to ensure that there aren't situations where a loop will accidentally run infinitely.

## Efficiency

Nested loops can result in programs that execute many individual steps, even using just a few lines of code. It is always helpful to think about the number of times a loop will execute and make sure that it isn't executing more times than necessary.
