Working with **Boolean** values in programming is a very important skill to learn. Previously, we saw how to work with Boolean values in pseudocode, and in this lab we'll cover the same content in the Python programming language. Once again, feel free to refer to other content in this course for information about Booleans, Boolean Logic, Boolean algebra, and other related topics.

In this lab, we'll learn how to create Boolean values in Python, as well as the various Boolean operators and comparators that can we can use in our code. Then, we'll explore how to use conditional statements to affect the **control flow** of our programs. This allows us to build programs that will perform different tasks based on the input we receive from the user, which is a very key concept in programming. Let's get to it!
