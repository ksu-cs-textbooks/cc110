In this lab, we covered several major important topics. Let's quickly review them.

## Pseudocode Conditional Statements

* if statement

```tex
IF(<boolean expression>)
{
    <block of statements>
}
```

* if-else statement

```tex
IF(<boolean expression>)
{
    <block of statements 1>
}
ELSE
{
    <block of statements 2>
}
```

## Python Conditional Statements

* if statement

```python
if <boolean expression>:
    <block of statements>
```

* if-else statement

```python
if <boolean expression>:
    <block of statements 1>
else:
    <block of statements 2>
```

## Testing

* Branch Coverage - all possible branches are executed at least once
* Path Coverage - all possible paths through branches are executed at least once
* Edge Cases - values that are near the point where Boolean expressions go from `false` to `true`
