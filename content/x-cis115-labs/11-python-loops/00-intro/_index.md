**Loops** are one of the most useful ways we can modify the **control flow** in our programs. With both loops and conditional statements in our list of available programming skills, we can write programs that execute different branches of code based on a Boolean expression, and we can also repeatedly execute the same piece of code either a defined number of times or while a Boolean expression evaluates to `True`. This allows us to build some truly useful programs.

In this lab, we're going to explore ways to use loops in Python. Python supports two different types of loops, **while loops** and **for loops**, both of which can be used in a variety of different ways in our programs. We'll also explore how to use these loops to receive input from the user and handle the case where a user provides invalid input, and finally we'll look at some ways to test our code containing loops to confirm that they are working correctly and won't cause issues. 

Let's get started!
