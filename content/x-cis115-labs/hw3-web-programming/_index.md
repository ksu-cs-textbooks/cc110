## The Assignment

Your assignment is to build a personal webpage on the CS Linux server or a personal web server/host if you so choose. Your site must be publicly accessible. Your grade will be based off of the URL submitted to Canvas **AND** the source files submitted to Canvas.  This is an individual assignment.   

Your site must contain 3 different files: `index.html`, `about.html` and `fancy.css`. They are described in detail below.

### HTML Page Requirements

Each HTML page on your site must, at a minimum, include the following items (more is perfectly fine): 

* Valid HTML5 code - use the [W3 Validator](http://validator.w3.org) to check that your HTML is correct
    * You may ignore any errors about character encoding
*  A `<head>` section that includes:  
    * The site's title in a `<title>` tag 
    * A reference to the site's CSS file in a `<link>` tag, such as `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="fancy.css">`
* A `<body>` section, containing your HTML content, which includes:
    * A header defined by the `<h1>` tag at the top of the page 
 
### Index File

Your `index.html` file is the homepage for your website. It should include the following, in addition to the HTML page requirements listed above:

* 4 paragraphs of text using the `<p>` tag. 
    * The paragraphs should be long enough to line-wrap a couple of times. Feel free to include placeholder text from Lorem Ipsum, one of your discussions, or elsewhere. 
* At least 1 word in each paragraph should be bolded using `<strong>`.
    * It is better to use `<strong>` than `<b>` since the former implies the intent, not just the style.
* At least 1 word in each paragraph should be italics using `<em>`. 
    * It is better to use `<em>` than `<i>` since the former implies the intent, not just the style.
* A working link to your `about.html` page in an `<a>` tag (it should be a relative URL, not an absolute path) 
* A working JavaScript Tic-Tac-Toe game (as shown in the videos and in class) 
 
### About File

Your `about.html` file gives a bit more information about yourself. It should include the following, in addition to the HTML page requirements listed above:

* 1 ordered `<ol>` or unordered `<ul>` list containing at least 4 list items using the `<li>` tag. 
    * Feel free to include your favorite movies or TV shows in the list. 
* 1 working link to your favorite site using the `<a>` anchor tag (this should be an absolute path). 
* 1 embedded image using the `<img>` tag. 
    * Choose a favorite image from Wikipedia to include on your site if you donâ€™t have one to share. 
* 1 embedded resource (Youtube Video, Twitter Feed, etc.) 
 
### CSS File

Your `fancy.css` file contains directives that are used to style your website. It should include directives to do the following: 

* Change the font used in your paragraph tags 
* Change the size of text in your headers 
* Change the color of text in your anchor (link) tags 
* Change the background color of your page (_no neon colors, please_) 
 
## Submitting
 
Submit the public URL of your `index.html` page (as an assignment comment) **AND** upload a ZIP file containing all of the HTML and CSS files used in your website to the assignment on Canvas.
