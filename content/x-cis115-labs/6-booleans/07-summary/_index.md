In this lab, we covered several major important topics. Let's quickly review them.

## Booleans in Pseudocode

* `true`
* `false`
* `BOOLEAN()` procedure to convert values
  * 0 is `false`, and any other number is `true`

## Pseudocode Boolean Operators

* `AND` 
* `OR`
* `NOT`

## Pseudocode Boolean Comparators

* `=` equal
* `!=` not equal
* `<` less than
* `<=` less than or equal to
* `>` greater than
* `>=` greater than or equal to

## Booleans in Python

* `True`
* `False`
* `bool()` procedure to convert values
  * If the input is the value `False`, the value `0`, the value `None`, or anything with 0 length, including the empty string, it will return `False`.
  * Otherwise, for all other values it will return `True`.

## Python Boolean Operators

* `and` 
* `or`
* `not`

## Python Boolean Comparators

* `==` equal
* `!=` not equal
* `<` less than
* `<=` less than or equal to
* `>` greater than
* `>=` greater than or equal to

## Comparators and Strings

Strings are compared using [lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order)

## Boolean Order of Operations

1. Math operators (following their order of operations)
1. Boolean comparators
1. `not`
1. `and`
1. `or`
