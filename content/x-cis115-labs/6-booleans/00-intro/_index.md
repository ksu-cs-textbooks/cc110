In this lab, we're going to introduce another data type in pseudocode, the **Boolean** data type. Elsewhere in this course, we've already learned about Boolean values and how they work, so we won't cover that information again here. Feel free to refer to other areas in this course for more background on Booleans, Boolean Logic, Boolean Algebra, and other related topics.

Here, we're going to focus on how we can use Boolean values in our pseudocode programs. Boolean values are very important in programming since they are used to determine the **control flow** of our program through conditional statements and looping statements. We'll be learning about these two types of statements over the next several labs. Both conditional statements and looping statements are key concepts in just about any programming language, and mastering them is the next step after learning the basic syntax of a programming language. So, let's get started!
