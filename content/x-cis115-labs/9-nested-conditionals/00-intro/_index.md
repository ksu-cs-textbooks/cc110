Conditional statements are a very powerful tool for programmers to use. In a previous lab, we explored simple conditional statements, including the if statement and if-else statement in both Python and pseudocode. However, up to this point we've only looked at how we can use a single conditional statement at a time in a program, which can be very limiting. So, in this lab, we're going to explore how we can combine conditional statements in a variety of different ways to build even more complex programs. These combined, or **nested** conditional statements, are commonly used across all programming languages, but learning how to build and debug them takes time and practice. We'll work through several examples, and then you'll get a chance to try it yourself.
